# Crypto Soccer Game Enhancement Task

## Current Issues to Fix
1. **Ball Boundary Problem**: The ball is not staying within the playable area
2. **Kick Animation Issue**: Kick animation plays but has no effect on the ball
3. **Missing Game Features**: Need to add reload option and crypto-themed abilities

## Required Implementations

### 1. Ball Physics and Boundary Correction
- Implement proper collision detection between the ball and the playable area boundaries
- Add bounce-back mechanics when the ball hits boundaries to keep it in play
- Ensure the ball's physics properties (mass, velocity, friction) are properly configured
- Debug the current boundary detection code to identify why the ball isn't staying in bounds

### 2. Kick Mechanics Enhancement
- Fix the spacebar kick functionality so the ball responds properly to player kicks
- Calculate appropriate force and direction for the ball based on player position and facing direction
- Ensure the kick animation timing syncs with the actual physics application on the ball
- Add visual feedback (e.g., small particle effect or motion blur) when the ball is successfully kicked
- Implement variable kick strength based on how long the spacebar is held (optional)
- Code sample structure for kick implementation:
```javascript
function handleKick(player, ball) {
  // Play kick animation
  player.playAnimation('kick');
  
  // Calculate kick direction vector based on player orientation
  const kickDirection = new THREE.Vector3(/* direction calculation */);
  
  // Apply force to ball
  const kickStrength = 5.0; // Adjust as needed
  ball.velocity.add(kickDirection.multiplyScalar(kickStrength));
  
  // Add kick sound effect
  playSound('kickSound');
}
```

### 3. Game Controls - Add Reload Option
- Implement a reload button or keyboard shortcut (e.g., 'R' key) to restart the current game
- Add a visual indicator for the reload option in the UI
- Ensure all game objects reset to their initial state when reloaded
- Consider adding a confirmation dialog before reloading to prevent accidental resets

### 4. Crypto-Themed Abilities System

#### Core Ability System:
- Create a base class/structure for abilities with common properties:
  - Name, punny title, image/icon, duration, effect magnitude
  - Spawn/despawn behavior
  - Collection detection
  - Visual and audio feedback on collection
  - Status effect application and expiration

#### Specific Abilities to Implement:
1. **Bitcoin Boost**
   - Title: "Mine Your Way to Victory!"
   - Visual: Floating 3D Bitcoin (₿) logo with gold material
   - Effect: Increases player movement speed by 50% for 5 seconds
   - Visual Feedback: Gold particle trail behind player when active

2. **Ethereum Energizer**
   - Title: "Smart Moves for Smart Players!"
   - Visual: Floating 3D Ethereum (Ξ) diamond logo with blue material
   - Effect: Enhances jump height by 75% for 5 seconds
   - Visual Feedback: Blue glow effect around player when active

3. **Dogecoin Dash**
   - Title: "To the Moon and Back!"
   - Visual: Floating 3D Dogecoin Shiba Inu with yellow material
   - Effect: Grants temporary invincibility and slight speed boost for 3 seconds
   - Visual Feedback: Pulsing shield effect and occasional "moon" emoji particles

#### Ability Spawning System:
- Spawn abilities randomly on the field every 20-30 seconds
- Ensure abilities appear in accessible locations (not inside obstacles or outside boundaries)
- Use proper z-indexing to ensure abilities appear above the playing field but below UI elements
- Make abilities rotate slowly in place and bob up/down slightly for visibility
- Add a subtle glow effect to make abilities stand out

#### Ability Collection and Effect Management:
- Detect collision between player and ability object
- Play collection animation and sound
- Apply the corresponding status effect to the player
- Display a timer or indicator showing remaining duration of the active effect
- Handle multiple abilities being active simultaneously (stacking or replacing)
- Properly clean up effects when they expire

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Ball stays within playable boundaries and bounces correctly
- [ ] Kick animation correctly applies force to the ball when spacebar is pressed
- [ ] Reload function properly resets the game state
- [ ] Abilities spawn at appropriate intervals in accessible locations
- [ ] Each ability displays correct visuals and applies the intended effect
- [ ] Effect durations work correctly with visible countdown
- [ ] Multiple abilities interact appropriately if collected in succession
- [ ] All visual and audio feedback works as expected

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Use Three.js for all 3D elements including the ability icons
- Maintain consistent physics timestep for reliable ball movement
- Optimize ability effects to prevent performance issues
- Consider using a state management system for tracking active abilities
- Implement proper cleanup of abilities and effects to prevent memory leaks
- Add appropriate sound effects with volume control for all interactions

## Optimization Considerations
- Use level-of-detail (LOD) for ability models when far from player
- Limit total number of concurrent abilities on field
- Optimize particle effects to maintain framerate
- Use object pooling for frequently spawned objects
