Prompt for AI Agent: Develop "Crypto Beach Soccer"
Develop a 3D web-based soccer game titled "Crypto Beach Soccer" using Three.js for rendering, Cannon.js for physics, and plain JavaScript for game logic. The game is a 1v1 soccer match inspired by Big Head Football, featuring blockchain meme concepts, and is themed around a beach setting. It must be playable on both desktop and mobile devices and optimized for vibe coding, with at least 80% AI-generated or AI-assisted code for the Orange Vibe Jam hackathon.
Game Specifications
Overview

Title: Crypto Beach Soccer
Concept: Players control characters with large cryptocurrency coin heads and beach-attired bodies, kicking a meme ball (Pepe the Frog) on a beach field. The game is single-player against an AI opponent, with each character having a unique crypto-inspired ability.
Objective: Score more goals than the opponent in a 3-minute match by kicking the ball into their net.

Features

Graphics: Use Three.js for 3D rendering. Create a 2.5D game (3D visuals, 2D movement plane) with pixelated or low-poly models for:
Beach field (sand texture, palm trees, beach goals made of driftwood or umbrellas).
Characters with big crypto coin heads and small bodies in beach attire.
Meme ball (3D Pepe the Frog model).


Physics: Use Cannon.js for ball movement, collisions, and basic player-ball interactions.
Gameplay:
Players move left/right, jump, and kick the ball.
3-minute matches; highest score wins.


Controls:
Desktop: Left/Right arrows (move), Up arrow (jump), Spacebar (kick), ‘E’ (ability).
Mobile: On-screen touch buttons for move, jump, kick, and ability.


Characters: Include at least 4 selectable characters:
Bitcoin (BTC): Golden coin head, male body in orange swim trunks + sunglasses. Ability: "Hodl" (immovable for 3s, cooldown 15s).
Ethereum (ETH): Silver coin head, female body in purple bikini + flip-flops. Ability: "Smart Contract" (spawns a barrier for 3s, cooldown 15s).
Dogecoin (DOGE): Bronze coin head with Shiba Inu, male body in red swimsuit. Ability: "To the Moon" (speed boost for 5s, cooldown 15s).
PepeCoin (PEPE): Green coin head, female body in green frog-patterned swimsuit. Ability: "Meme Magic" (reverses opponent controls for 3s, cooldown 15s).


AI Opponent: Simple AI that chases the ball and kicks toward the player’s goal.
Login System:

Add a guest login option where players enter a username to play instantly (no progress saved).


UI: Simple interface with:
Main menu (play, character select, login options).
In-game HUD (score, timer, ability cooldown).



Technical Requirements

Platform: Web-based, responsive for desktop and mobile.
Tech Stack: Three.js, Cannon.js, plain JavaScript.
Assets: Generate or use simple 3D models/textures for characters, ball, and field.
Code: At least 80% AI-written or AI-assisted, suitable for hackathon submission.

Deliverables
Provide complete code including:

HTML: Base structure with Three.js and Cannon.js CDN links.
CSS: Responsive styling for desktop/mobile.
JavaScript: Game logic, rendering, physics, controls, AI, and login integration.
Any necessary assets (e.g., textures or model references).

Notes

Keep development simple for quick AI execution (e.g., basic shapes for models, minimal animations).
Ensure the game is fun with quirky blockchain meme vibes and beach flair.
Prioritize core gameplay (movement, kicking, scoring) before adding abilities and login features.
