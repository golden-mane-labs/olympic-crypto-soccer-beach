## Gameplay Mechanics

### Basic Rules
- Matches last 3 minutes
- Player with most goals at the end wins
- If tied at the end of regulation time, the game ends in a draw

### Field Navigation
- The beach field has sandy terrain that affects ball physics
- Palm trees around the perimeter are solid obstacles
- Goals are positioned at both ends of the field

### Ball Control
- **Basic Movement**: Position your player near the ball to make contact
- **Ball Physics**: The ball obeys realistic gravity and momentum
- **Control Radius**: Each character has a default ball control radius (Bitcoin and PepeCoin have better radius)
- **Ball Reset**: Press R if the ball gets stuck or falls off the field

### Kicking Mechanics
- **Power**: Kick strength varies based on character abilities and power-ups
- **Direction**: The ball generally travels in the direction your character is facing
- **Aerial Kicks**: Jump before kicking for a higher trajectory
- **Projectile Motion**: Kicks follow realistic arcs based on power and angle

## Power-ups

Power-ups appear on the field as glowing cryptocurrency coins. These provide temporary ability boosts without using your character's special ability.

### Power-up Types
All power-ups correspond to the four character abilities:
- **Bitcoin Coin**: Increases kick power and ball control
- **Ethereum Coin**: Boosts jump height and speed
- **Dogecoin Coin**: Grants temporary invincibility and speed
- **PepeCoin Coin**: Enhances all character stats

### Power-up Mechanics
- Power-ups spawn randomly on the field every 15-30 seconds
- A maximum of 3 power-ups can exist on the field at once
- Collected power-ups activate immediately for their specified duration
- PepeCoin power-ups are rare (15% spawn chance) but offer the greatest benefits
